First we use the hashtable to store the data from the paraser file includes the movie, genres, stars info
The we use the hash table to store the data from the database. For example, the data from movies table, the data from genres table, the data from stars table, the data from
stars_in_movies, and the data from genres_in_movies. We use the hash table which contains the database data to deep compare with the hashtable from the paraser to prevent the 
reducdent data. The search and insert time complex of hashtable is O(1). It is very fast.
At the end we use the batch insert to insert all the parser data to the database.
